1. What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building fast, interactive user interfaces. Itâ€™s component-based, meaning that the UI is divided into small, reusable pieces of code called components.

Why React?
Efficient rendering with its virtual DOM.
Component reusability.
A large community and ecosystem of libraries.
2. What is Vite?
Vite is a build tool that makes the development process fast and efficient. It provides instant hot module replacement (HMR), which speeds up the development process.

3. What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types. It allows us to catch errors earlier in development by defining types for variables and functions.

Setup: Create Your First React Project with Vite and TypeScript
Install Vite and Create a New Project

Open your terminal and run the following commands:



npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev


React.FC: Stands for "function component" and ensures that your component is typed correctly.
JSX: The syntax that looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript, used to define the UI in React.


React Components: Components are like building blocks of a React application. A component is a JavaScript function or class that optionally accepts inputs (called "props") and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI should appear.

Vite Advantages: Vite is faster than traditional tools like create-react-app because it builds and serves the project with instant updates.
