# Best Practices for Next.js Project Structure

When developing with Next.js, it's important to follow a consistent and scalable project structure to ensure maintainability and ease of collaboration as your application grows. Below is a guide for organizing your Next.js project to adhere to best practices.

### Key Folders and Files Explained

- **`/pages/`**: This is where the core routing happens. Each `.js` file in this directory automatically becomes a route in your app. Special files like `_app.js` and `_document.js` are used to customize the app's behavior and layout.
- **`/components/`**: Reusable UI components should go here. Organizing components into directories by feature or function is helpful for larger applications.

- **`/styles/`**: Place your global styles and CSS modules here. Next.js supports global CSS, CSS modules, and even Sass. Organizing styles in this directory helps you scale them as your app grows.

- **`/lib/`**: Utility functions and helper files for interacting with external APIs, managing date/time functions, or any other shared logic should go in this folder.

- **`/hooks/`**: Custom React hooks, like those for managing localStorage, forms, or authentication, should be stored in the `hooks` folder.

- **`/context/`**: Use this folder for context providers to manage global state. For example, authentication or theme management contexts can be defined here.

- **`/middleware/`**: If you are using Next.js middleware for server-side logic (such as API authentication or logging), place them in this directory.

- **`/tests/`**: It is important to add tests for your components, pages, and APIs. Organize your test files similarly to your main directory structure.

## **File Naming Conventions**

Consistent naming conventions will help improve the readability of your project. Here are a few conventions to follow:

- **Components**:

  - Use `PascalCase` for component file names: `Header.js`, `Footer.js`, etc.
  - Use folders for complex components with multiple files (e.g., `Button/` with `index.js` and `styles.css`).

- **Pages**:

  - Use `camelCase` or `kebab-case` for page routes: `index.js`, `about.js`, etc.
  - Special pages like `_app.js`, `_document.js`, `_error.js` should be named exactly as such.

- **API Routes**:

  - Use the `kebab-case` for naming API routes: `get-user.js`, `update-profile.js`.

- **Styles**:

  - Use CSS modules to scope styles by component (e.g., `Header.module.css`), and use global styles (e.g., `globals.css`) for general styling.

- **Hooks**:
  - Use `use` prefix for custom hooks, e.g., `useAuth.js`, `useLocalStorage.js`.

## **Modularize by Features**

As your application grows, organizing your app by features (also known as **domain-driven design**) becomes important for maintainability. Here's an example structure for feature-based organization:

/my-next-app │ ├── /features/
│ ├── /auth/
│ │ ├── AuthContext.js │ │ ├── useAuth.js │ │ ├── login.js │ │ └── signup.js │ ├── /profile/ │ │ ├── ProfilePage.js │ │ ├── ProfileForm.js │ │ └── useProfile.js │ └── /posts/ │ ├── PostList.js │ ├── PostDetail.js │ └── usePosts.js └── ...

### Benefits:

- Encapsulates related logic (components, hooks, context, API) into a single folder for each feature.
- Improves collaboration and scalability by organizing code around features.
- Reduces friction when refactoring or adding new features.

## **Environment Variables**

Use environment variables to manage configurations that change between development, staging, and production environments.

Create `.env.local`, `.env.production`, or `.env.development` files for environment-specific variables. For example:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
