React Router for Navigation
In this lesson, we will learn about React Router, a powerful library that allows you to manage navigation and routing in your React applications. React Router helps create a single-page application (SPA) with multiple views, while keeping the URL in sync with the components being rendered.

What is React Router?
React Router is a routing library for React that enables you to:

Define different routes for your app.
Display different components based on the current URL.
Navigate between views without reloading the page.
Why Use React Router?
Single Page Application (SPA): Helps create dynamic, client-side routing where only the required components are re-rendered instead of reloading the entire page.
URL-based Routing: Keeps the browser's URL in sync with the views, making your app more intuitive and shareable via links.
Nested Routes: Supports nested views for complex page structures, such as a dashboard with different sections.
Installing React Router
To use React Router, you need to install the react-router-dom package in your project:


npm install react-router-dom

For TypeScript, you'll also need the types:

npm install @types/react-router-dom
